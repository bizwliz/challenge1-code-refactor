# Challenge 1 Code Refactor Project 

For the first challenge of this bootcamp it will be going over the importance of semantics as well as anti-semantics, the importance of consolidation for a cleaner and easy to read code, and how to and why your projects should always include a README file. 

- What was your motivation?
To understand the basic foundation of coding
- Why did you build this project? 
Gained knowledge and hours on coding to advance in a timely manner
- What problem does it solve?
the ability to create a clean code as well as get familiar with semantics
- What did you learn?
I learned how to identify and label semantics as well as how to consolidate a css coding to not take up unnecessary space. 

## Installation
<ol>
    <li>Create Repository on Github</li>
    <li>Clone Repository to Computer and open in VS Code</li>
    <li>Copy base code in VS Code and commit changes</li>
    <li>Review over code to turn the anti-semantics to semantics</li>
    <li>Review CSS to consolidate code</li>
    <li>Create and modify README file</li>
    <li>Deploy link</li>
    <li>Submit Github Repository Link and Deployed live website link</li>
</ol>

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I truly benefited from working alongside my piers:
<ul>
    <li> Annie Sosa</li>
    <li>Jovanni Bogardus</li>
    <li>Rujaine Mena</li>
    <li>Mia Olmedillo</li>
    <li>Lourdes Dorvilus</li>
</ul>
The link to W3 Schools also helped my understanding of semantics and anti semantics: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">W3 Schools</a>
